## Technologies

## User Story
```
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
```
## Installation
IndexedDB, PWA, MongoDB
## Mockup

## Usage
### Offline Functionality
- Use IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB as a refresher on how to add this to your application.
- Add a service worker to your application. Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Using Service Workers as a refresher on how to add this to your application.
- Used the ```webpack-dev-server``` npm module to test the service worker with an HTTPS-enabled server.
### Web Manifest
- Need to add a web manifest to your application with the app’s metadata, to let users’ devices know what they’re installing and how the app should look on the home screen.
